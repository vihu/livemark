## CommonMark and GFM spec examples

`tests/fixtures/spec/commonmark-0.31.2.json` is the example list of the
CommonMark Spec 0.31.2 (https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/spec.json), and
`tests/fixtures/spec/gfm-0.29-extensions.json` holds the extension examples
of the GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec 0.29-gfm, extracted from
https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/blob/master/test/spec.txt by
`tests/fixtures/spec/gfm_extensions.py`.

Both specs are copyright John MacFarlane (the GFM spec with GitHub's
extensions) and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
4.0 International licence: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/.
The example files are used unchanged apart from that extraction, as test
data only.
